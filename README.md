# Design Decisions
The design follows a minimalistic approach by only displaying content that is of value to the visitor, 
and keeping any overflow out of the design process, and relying heavily on dynamic user content. 
The Grandma's Cookbook takes much inspiration from the project Task-Manager from Coding Institute
Grandma's Cookbook uses light vintage like  colors, to have a clear contrast with the websyte vintage theme  to enhance 
overall visibility, and minimizing bombarding the visitors with colors, but rather finding the appropriate places to apply them.

## Typography
I choose to use Yesteryear for the text headers due to it's vintage looks and give the page a bit more personality and the roboto for the main texts to help with readability.
